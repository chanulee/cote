As Cote uses Apple's CoreML for face tracking, it is recommended to use Apple computers for the recreation. (If it's not possible, use faceOSC instead)  
1. Update your macbook and download Xcode. For this exhibition, I'm using macOS Sonoma and Xcode 15.
2. Download wekinator [here](http://www.wekinator.org/downloads/)
3. Download openFrameworks [here](https://openframeworks.cc/download/)
5. Download visionOSC [here](https://github.com/LingDong-/VisionOSC)
### Essential Configurations
4. Check & download ofxOsc

## 2. Hardware Installation
- Macbook Pro 15 + USB-C Charger
- Control Box
- Motor Modules
- Webcam (Logitech C270) + USB-A to C Converter
- PCA9685 Motor Driver (for power delivery, should be connected to power and arduino)

**InterPlay Exhibition Information**   
Do you ever stop to reflect how much the design of motion in everyday ob- jects affects your daily routine? Have you ever thought that behind every-
day actions there was a creative mind designing the motion?  
Firstly you will encounter a selection of experimental kinetic objects from ‘Cyber Physical Systems’; a workshop of the joint programmes at Imperial College and the Royal College of Art of Innovation Design Engineering and Global Innovation Design. The devices use Arduino computers and Ai software to propose speculative kinetic designs that translate human behaviour into robotic motion.  
The Design Education Trust invites you to delve into a playful experience aiming to lift your spirits in these dour times. Join us between the 5th and 9th December to see our free INTERPLAY EXHIBITION at the ROYAL SOCIETY of SCULPTORS.
- Venue: The Royal Society of Sculptors, Dora House 108 Old Brompton Rd, London SW7 3RA
- The Design Education Trust, Royal Society of Sculptors
